<h3>Holo - The Name</h3>
<p>Holo was created with simplicity and user experience in mind, while also offering a fresh, never before seen approach to smartphone technology.<br><br>
        Holo references the phones holographic technology, a big selling feature to the product as no other phones in the market have offered this capability yet.<br><br>
        Holo also wanted to grab the users attention. They say things start with “Hello” and Holo is a word similar enough to start the conversation between the company and the market.<br><br>
        Holo also references the “hollowness” of the phone itself. It is completely see through, besides the bottom bar added for hardware and user ease, giving it a “hollow” feel.
        </p>
</div>

<div class="infoText">
    <h3>The Logo</h3>
    <p>We decided to keep a crisp, fresh and clean approach to Holo’s logo. Opting for a crystal, which is mysterious and unique by nature; attributes this brand holds as well. 
            The sleek blue and sharp lines of the logo give the crystals a more futuristic look as well. Taking something original and pushing it farther. 
            </p>

    <div class="infoText">
        <h3>The Phone</h3>
        <p>The phone itself resembles a typical smartphone shape, for user familiarity. There is a hardware bar at the bottom with a touch ID button in the shape of Holo’s crystal logo, bringing the brand front and centre while still keeping the futuristic look to the phone. This bottom car also has solar panels built into it, for a constant on-the-go charge letting users get the most out of their device. <br><br>
                The top of the phone has a front and rear facing camera built seamlessly into the screen so it is almost undetected at first glance. <br><br>
                Volume controls are located at the side and use touch to swipe up or down to lower the sound, activating a blue light when users are applying this function for visualization. <br><br>
                The back of the phone is branded with the crystal logo as well. This cannot be seen from the front of the phone when in use. It is etched in a way it reflects off the back. The back is also coated in a mirror finish to protect users privacy.<br><br>

                <h4>Privacy</h4>
                <P>With a see-through phone, privacy is the main concern. Holo has integrated a rivacy glass display. Think of a one-way window, this is what Holo implemented. Users can see right through to the other side, but anyone facing the back of the phone only sees their reflection. </P>
                <h4>Viewing</h4>
                <P>To keep viewing easy for the user, there is a built in opacity changer function. This allows the user to make the background opaque or transparent, and any degree in between depending on their preference. </P>
            </div>

        <h3>The Build</h3>
    <p>At BioTecture, our goal is to not only raise awareness for our brand, but the process of organ regeneration as well. This type of engineering can save many lives if given the chance and proper promotion. Our goal is to make people aware of the organ regeneration BioTecture offers, and how they can either help, or possibly receive treatment themselves.</p>

    <div class="infoText">
    <h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>To put into full perspective just exactly what Holo looks like, we did our initial rendering in Cinema 4D. Giving a real life look at the product.
        This also allowed us to demonstrate features such as the holographic display.<br>
        A completely transparent phone should be shown off. So we decided to scrap traditional phone packaging and opt for a clear, glass display case, demonstrating the transparent capabilities.
        Again rendering this out in Cinema 4D.<br>
        Building Lexan’s phone required a whole new system. Therefore we couldn’t rely on traditional android or iPhone system builds and created our own operating system.
        The layout mimicks other system layouts for easy user experience while incorporating the new technologies Holo has to offer.<br><br>
        All renderings done in Photoshop.
